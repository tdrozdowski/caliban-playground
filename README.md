# Caliban Playground
This project is a refined set of examples on how to use Caliban - a ZIO based GraphQL server and client library.  The examples are based off the core Caliban examples - but go a few steps further to help illustrate how things such as Auth could be applied in more of a production scenario.

This is primarily for my learning/experimentation - anyone is free to use these for their own nefarious purposes.

At some point these may show up as a PR back to the Caliban project if anything worthwhile emerges here. :)
